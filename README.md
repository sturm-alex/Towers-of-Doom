## Getting Started

This project is a small Tower Defense X Bullet Heaven Mash-Up!

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

`.vscode/settings.json` contains the library folder, where the `core.jar` ist located. Modify to suit your needs!
The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
